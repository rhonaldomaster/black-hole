# Black Hole

Starter theme for Shopify devs. Includes the minimal things to start.

## Features

- Preconnect to shopify cdn
- Insert your critical css, other stylesheets can be deferred (see theme.liquid)
- JavaScript code before closing the body!
- .editorconfig, .gitignore and config.yml files included
- Compatible with shopify themes 2.0
- Includes minimal code to start creating your own theme

## Why?

Default theme from shopify cli (dawn) is bloated with things theme devs don't use. Black holes are powerful and small.
